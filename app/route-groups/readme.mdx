# Route Grouping

Route groups let you organize your application's structure without affecting the URL. You can create different layouts for specific sections and keep your codebase tidy.

### Example

- This example uses groups to create shared layouts in different parts of the app.
  - (main): main interface
    - (shop): shop section
    - (marketing): marketing section
  - (checkout): group that doesn't use the main layout

Navigate between pages and see how layouts change depending on the section.
