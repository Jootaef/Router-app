# Nested Layouts

A layout is an interface shared between multiple routes. When navigating, layouts keep their state and do not re-render, improving the user experience.

### Example

1. Navigate between categories and subcategories.
2. Notice that layouts do not reload when changing routes.
3. Client state (like a counter) is preserved between navigations.
4. You can interact with the layout even while other routes are loading.
